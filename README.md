# Brutal Notes

I took some established speech recognition code written in vanilla Javascript and expanded its functionality by refactoring it into a react app, setting up a JSON database for storage of the notes and added styling. The style is influenced by the current design trend of neubrutalism (hence brutal notes). This style is used by companies like Gumroad.com Figma and MongoDB.
